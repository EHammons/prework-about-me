      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Crafts, music and mobile games.</p>

      <p>Invent something world changing and make so much money I can help others without worrying about my own bills.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Currently in Georgetown, TX.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I come from an engineering family and am the only graphic designer I know who cannot draw. By learning (and mastering) web development, I will have the skills to be a one stop shop for graphics as well as the coding behind sites. It will allow me to use my technical side to develop better and bigger projects.</p>
